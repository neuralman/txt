While programming coursework on an IBM 360/75 as a computer science student, was fortunate to have also been hired as a systems programmer on the seminal University of Illinois PLATO project at the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory (CERL), thanks to Paul Tenczar and Don Bitzer.

Was exposed to eMail and online discussions (a.k.a. “Notes”), instant messaging and chat rooms (a.k.a. "Talkomatic"), massive multiplayer gaming, online project collaboration. See less
