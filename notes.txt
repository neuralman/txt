comedy
...

. It’s a musical flow; 
a comedic symphony of relatable experiences and observations 
bonded together through transitional phrases.

. To start, come up with a funny concept based around 
your own personal experiences or observations.

JOKE 1:
...
ESTABLISHING THE CONCEPT:
. I grew up with a really beautiful sister.

EMPHASIZING CONCEPT + CREATING A BUILD UP:
. And I’m not just talking conventional beauty; I’m talking like if I were to 
bring her into this room right now, you would all just miraculously become single…

PUNCH:
. Including the ladies.

This intro works well for making an audience connection—when I say 
“including the ladies”, I generally try to make eye contact with 
one specific female who looks to be on a date or married, as it creates 
an air of light tension and mild discomfort, leading to lots of laughs.


JOKE 2:
...
BUILD UP:
. When we were kids, people used to say that she looked like 
a young Jessica Simpson.

PUNCH:
. I, on the other hand, kinda looked more like a Jewish Honey Boo Boo.

EMPHASIS:
. I’m just sorta sweating in all of my childhood photos.

This is probably the only joke of mine that gets a roar every single time 
I’ve told it. The “Jewish Honey Boo Boo” creates a funny visual and is also 
a funny-sounding word, so even if audiences aren’t familiar with Honey Boo Boo 
(the reality TV star), they still feel inclined to laugh.

JOKE 3:
...
BUILD UP: 
. I was talking to my mom about it recently—this contrast between my sister 
and me. And she actually wound up telling me that she used to get nervous 
about bringing my sister and me out in public together

PUNCH:
. ...because she didn’t want people to think we had different fathers. (Pause.)

EMPHASIS: 
. Thanks, Mom! Did you really need to tell me that?

This is actually not true at all, but is believable enough to work, 
and it gets laughs due to the shock factor. It’s almost always followed by 
an “ooooohhhhhh” from the audience.

Bonus tip: Create opportunities to pivot

All right, so I’ve established the premise, sprinkled in a few sillys, and 
then added the shock factor—so now I have to decide; do I switch to 
a new concept or keep going with it? It’s 100% dependent on the audience 
response. If they seem bored or antsy, I shift to a new concept. 
If they really seem to be digging the “ugly duckling, underdog” thing, 
I add this bit to round it out and ensure that it ends on a positive note:

Fortunately, I did develop some good coping mechanisms as I got older, 
such as celebrating my sister’s misfortunes. It’s like when a coworker gets a 
promotion you want, and then the next day they get in a car accident, 
and on the outside you’re like ‘Ohh nooo…’ but on the inside you’re like 
‘Ohhh yeahhhh’… same thing.

My sister got pregnant at the age of 16. Which, we’re from Texas and teen 
pregnancy is actually pretty normal down there—in fact, it’s kind of a 
rite of passage. But my family wasn’t having it. They were so upset and 
thought she was ruining her life…, even wanted her to get an abortion. 
I, on the other hand was like brinnnng onnnn the stretch marks… 
the babyyyy weight.. in fact, let’s just throw this sh*t up on 
“16 and Pregnant.” I’ll even fill out the submission packet. (pause) 
Which I did. I submitted my sister to “16 and Pregnant.” 
But apparently there’s a certain level of trashy you have to be to 
get on the show, and my sister fell just below the cusp.

the mechanics of comedy
...
. comedy is 100% natural
. humor is made up of 2 components: safety and violation
. i went to the zoo the other day,
. there was only one dog in it,
. it was a shitzu.
. the 2nd understanding reveals the comedic conflict.  there's an overlap 
  between safety (shitzu) and violation (shit zoo) the quick switch allows
  for both ideas to be in the audience's head at the same time
  the humor doesn't come from shitzu or shit zoo, it comes from the 
  juxtabposition (combonination/overlap) of them
. a woman gets on a bus with her baby.
  the bus driver says:
  'ugh, that's the ugliest baby i've evern seen!'
  the woman walks to the rear of the bus and sits down,
  fuming.
  she says to the man next to her:
  'the driver just insulted me!'
  the man says: 'you go up there and tell him off.
  go on, i'll hold your monkey for you.'
. on her side / but insulted her more

VIOLATION
...
. violation of a norm 
  a good example is a cultural norm
. linguistic violation
  the pun - play on words
. i was a very "driven" boy scout.
  very "driven"!
  "driven" everywhere i was
. i said to the gym instructor
  can you teach me to do the splits?
  he said, how "flexible" are you?
  i said, i can't make tuesdays
. police arrested 2 kids yesterday,
  one was drinking battery acid,
  the other was eating fireworks
  they charged one -
  and let the other one off.
  
VIOLATION OF OUR PREDICTIONS
...
. 3 count joke formula
  list of 3 things and the first 2 are normal
  setting a patterns
  before the 3rd surprises us
. 3 guys stranded on a desert island, find a magic latern 
  containing a genie, who grants them each 1 wish.
  the first guy wishes he was off the island and back home
  the second buy wishes the same
  the thrid guys says, "i'm lonely i wish my firends were back here"
. steve martin's anti-comedy.
  1. babies are illogical
  2. nobody is dispised who can manage a crododile
  3. illogical persons are despised
  therefore, babies cannot manage crocodiles.
  
SAFETY
...
. lewis black + sarah silverman
. very aggressive but still a lightheartedness
. sarah silverman pushes the boundaries of what's acceptable 
  the reason she can do that is because her personality on state creates a safe place
  in which we con't feel like we have to take her words as threatening
. anthony jeselnik - his laughs usually come from how far into a violation he can take the audience while still
  being liked
  throughout the set, there's a calmness to the delivery that hels create a place
  where the audience feels safe laughing at what many of them probably consider to be horrible things
. creates safety on how he says his material
. my one skill in life
  is being able to say horrible things
  and still be likable
  if you take out the whole
  and just read my material
  it's a bad read
  
SAFETY + VIOLATION = COMEDIC CONFLICT

our first job is to SHAPE OUR COMEDIC SPACE

stephen wright - low energy, monotone delivery - sets him up for success very quickly

rule of three
...
broken prediction

broken assumption
...
. everytime you speak you're giving the listener info about the who what where when why or how of your story

. steve martin
  i gave my cat a bath the other day
  they it
  he sat there
  he enjoyed it
  and it was fun for me tooling
  the fur would stick to my tongue
  but other than that
  
. audience needs to go through 3 stages to understand a joke
  1. construction
  2. recognition
  3. resolution
  
. how to write EXAGGERATION JOKES
. in order to create an exaggeration from a joke format, take your punchline's key word's
  (the one that makes it funny) and see if you can stretch it one way or the other
  if the joke is about size, then ask your self" what is really small or big and fit
  it inside your joke till you find the right one.
. not too much or too little
. write a few sentences about an experience 
  look over what you've written and find ideas that can exaggerated (size emontional reactions etc)
  rewrite or add on to what you've written using the exaggeration
  rewrite the joke so that it flows better
  
. how to write MISPLACED SINCERITY JOKES
. steve martin
  i went to france
  if you go to france let me give you a warning
  chapeau means hat
  oeuf means egg
  it's like those french have a different word for EVERYTHING!
. begin with something pre-written or write a few sentences of a setup
. find any ideas or phrases that are easy to misunderstand or require specific knowledge 
  (phrases like "go jump on a horses" or "raining cats and dogs " are easy
. ask yourself "what would happen if i misunderstood or didn't have this info?"

. how to write CONTRADICTION jokes
. contradiction is a mix of misplaced sincerity, irony, and POV humor
. in a contradiction, the comic says a line that contradicts what he's meaning to say
. there are 2 important characteristics to a good contradiction:
  SPEED and BELIEVABILITY
. only have 1-2 lines to create the contradiction

3 types of contradictions
1. words contradict words
2. words contradict actions
3. words contradict what audience already knows

sarcasm falls in this category
sarcasm gets humor from a comedic conflict between words and how the words are said
. saying "you're a genis" in a way that means you're an idiot

words and action
. i can drink as much alcohol as it want
  and it doesn't affect me
  (loses balance and crashes into the mic stand)
  
words and what audience already knows
. steven wright

RULE OF 3 JOKES AKA LIST JOKES
...
. best known type
. 2 similar 1 does not belong - breaks patterns

how to write puns/ double -entendres
. lowes form of humor

. i got a friend
  she's got a theory
  she reckons the way to drive a man wild with desire is to 
  nibble on his earlobes for hours and hours
  i think it's bollox (bull shit)

how to write META-JOKES
. meta-jokes are jokes about jokes

how to write OMITTED PUNCHLINE JOKES
. intentionally leaves out the last word(s) of a punchline so the audience can fill in the rest
. substitute a gesture for the missing words

let me make something clear
it's not that the wind is blowin
it's what the wind is blowing
if you get hit by a volvo
it doesn't matter how many sit-ups you did that night

callback lines
. ref something a comic said earlier in the show
. inside-joke
. audience needs to forgit about the line - lose majority of it's power
. surprise that the line is reused and the context you are using the line

3 pillars of successful comics
1. the pillar of effectiveness
2. the pillar of uniqueness
3. the pillar of authenticity

i grew up with 6 brothers
that's how i learned to dance
waiting for the bathroom

* audiences have always, and will always, value uniqueness

Fumio Sasaki is not an enlightened minimalism expert or organizing guru like Marie Kondo – he’s just a regular guy who was stressed out and constantly comparing himself to others, until one day he decided to change his life by saying goodbye to everything he didn’t actually need.

he owned “a total of about 150 items, which includes everything from clothes, futon, and toothbrush, to bottles of condiments in his kitchen.”

12 Ways I’ve Changed Since I Said Goodbye to My Things

I have more time.
I enjoy life more.
I have more freedom.
I no longer compare myself with others.
I stopped worrying about how others see me.
I’m more engaged with the world around me.
I can focus better and concentrate on being me.
I save money and care more about the environment.
I’m healthier and safer.
My interpersonal relationships are deeper.
I can savor the present moment.
I feel true gratitude.

Sasaki defines “minimal” as retaining just what is necessary for an individual. 

https://janisholtireg.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/goodbye-things-the-new-japanese-minimalism-by-fumio-sasaki.pdf

“You can avoid buying more things simply by first asking yourself if it’s something that you actually need.” 

“Ask yourself which of your items would truly be necessary if you were to start with zero belongings. What if everything you owned was stolen? What if you had to move next week? Which items would you take with you? There are probably a lot of things we have sitting around in our homes for no particular reason. Think about starting from scratch, and it will become clear which items are essential.”

eft - emotional freedom technique
...
. fast results and transformation

http://gettingthru.org/eftvideos/eft-manual.pdf

"all that we are is the result of what we have thought.  
if a man speaks or acts with an evil thought,
pain follows him.  
if a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, 
happiness follows him,
like a shadow that never leaves him."

"be aware that the world is what you think it is, so decide what you want to believe today."

if you start to pay attention to the reality your thoughts are creating, 
everything in your world can begin to change.  
but increased awareness presents another dilemma.  
research shows that each of us has somewhere around 70,000 thoughts each day.
that's alot of thinking to monitor.  no wonder we feel so overwhelmed!

your emotional state provides an overview of your thinking.
clearning emotions can shift the quality of your thinking, 
producing new perspectives on who you are and what might be possible.
this also highlights the power of a holistic approach - 
integrating the body, emotions, mind, and spirit.

"the real voyage of discovery consists 
not in seeking new lands but seeing with new eyes."

"the natural healing force within each one of us is the greatest force in getting well."

by relieving imbalances in their client's energy systems

it can be faster, easier, and much more effective than many would imagine.

when the energy system is out of balance, 
our emotional life could be compared to a car that is desperate need of a tune up.
the result may take the form of any type of emotional disturbance including phobias, anger, depression, grief, guilt, anxiety, 
and a full range of fears, to name a few.
there may also be physical symptoms like pain,
headaches, asthma and tension that are related to the emotions.

stress, which has been linked to just about every deadly disease is a prime example.

feelings of happiness and well-being have a positive impact on every aspect of life.
feeling good is the first goal on a path to your dreams.

it contends that the cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system.

with remarkable consistency, eft relieves symptoms by an unusual (but scientific) 
routine of tapping with the fingertips on a short series of points on the body that correspond to 
acupuncture points on the energy meridians.
where there is an imbalance, 
there is a corresponding blockage in the flow of energy through the meridian system.

the tapping serves to release the blockages that are created when a person thinks about
or becomes involved in an emotionally disturbing circumstance.
when this blockage is released, the emotions come into balance.
once balanced, the person cannot get upset
about the circumstance no matter how hard they try.
the memory remains but the charge is gone.
with these kinds of results, 
it's not surprising that the healing power of EFT is becoming widely recognized.

https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/home

"EFT offers great healing benefits."

most energetic imbalances may be partially or completely relieved within a short time using this process.
others may be relieved through repetition of the process.

some examples of energetic patterns that have been successfully cleared using eft:
. fears related to performance like public speaking, concentration, sports, etc.
. phobias like the fear of heights, flying, enclosed spaces, driving, etc.
. emotional trauma from war experiences, physical abuse, etc.
. disturbing emotions like depression and anger.
. emotions related to addictive patterns like eating and smoking
. insomnia
. emotions related to physical conditions

how long do the results last?
. eft is generally long lasting
. physical healings are often impressive and long lasting as well
. but are more likely to re-emerge than emotional issues

basic recipe or short sequence is most commonly used

trailhead.com/me/jhuang4
eft does not involve the use of needles, chemicals, or invasive surgical procedures.
it includes gentle tapping in specific places on the body, humming, counting, and rotating your eyes.

the responsibility for your emotional and physical well-being must rest with you

STEPS IN THE EFT BASIC RECIPE (THE SHORT SEQUENCE)

before starting, you need to have a single, specific issue in mind.
if nothing comes immediately to mind, consider experimenting with your current stress level and how it feels
in your body. this will give you something to evaluate before and after the tapping.

1. THE SETUP:
. focus on bringing an emotion issue into your awareness in the present moment.
. the key to the success of this process is to feel the emotion and set up the blockage in the meridian system.
. if you want ot reduce the intensity of the emotion, imagine moving away from it or placing a viel between you
and the emotion, so it feels comfortable.

2. THE EVALUATION: 
. when you have brough the emotion up to it's full intensity
. or whatever intensity feels comfortable, evaluate how strong it feels between 1 and 10

3. THE AFFIRMATION: 
. while rubbing the "tender spot" on the chest (see diagram below for location) 
. in a circular fashion, repeat the following affirmation three times:
. "even though i have this ______, i deeply and completely accept my-self."
. Another option to rubbing the tender spot is to tap continuously on the heel of one hand
. (the side away from the thumb) with the fingers of your other hand.
